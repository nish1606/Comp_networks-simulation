Network Topologies in Cisco Packet Tracer
This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to configure two fundamental network topologies in Cisco Packet Tracer: Star Topology and Mesh Topology. This is a great exercise for students and network enthusiasts to understand how different network layouts function.

What is Cisco Packet Tracer?
Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation tool that allows you to create network topologies, configure devices, and test network connectivity without requiring physical hardware.

1. Star Topology
A star topology is a network configuration in which each node (e.g., a computer) is individually connected to a central networking device, such as a switch or a hub. All data on the network must pass through this central point.

Advantages
Easy to manage: Centralized management makes it simple to add or remove devices.

Fault isolation: If one device or cable fails, it does not affect the rest of the network.

Disadvantages
Single point of failure: If the central switch/hub fails, the entire network goes down.

Higher cost: Requires more cabling than a bus topology.

Steps to Configure in Packet Tracer
Add Devices:

From the "Network Devices" menu, select a Switch (e.g., 2960-24TT).

From the "End Devices" menu, add several PCs (e.g., PC0, PC1, PC2).

Connect Devices:

Select the Connections tool (the lightning bolt icon).

Choose the Copper Straight-Through cable.

Click on a PC, select FastEthernet0, and then click on the Switch. Select an available FastEthernet port on the switch.

Repeat this for all PCs, connecting each one to a separate port on the switch.

Configure IP Addresses:

Click on each PC and go to the Desktop > IP Configuration tab.

Assign a static IPv4 address and subnet mask to each PC within the same network.

PC0: IP Address: 192.168.1.1, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

PC1: IP Address: 192.168.1.2, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

PC2: IP Address: 192.168.1.3, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Test Connectivity:

From PC0, open the Command Prompt and use the ping command to test the connection to another PC.

ping 192.168.1.2

You should see successful replies, confirming that the network is configured correctly.

2. Mesh Topology
A full mesh topology is a network setup in which every device is connected to every other device in the network. This creates multiple redundant paths for data transmission.

Advantages
High reliability and redundancy: If one link fails, data can still be transmitted through an alternative path.

Fast communication: Data travels directly from the source to the destination without passing through an intermediary device.

Disadvantages
High cost: Requires a large amount of cabling and a significant number of ports on each device.

Complex to manage: The number of connections can be difficult to set up and manage. The number of connections required for a full mesh topology is calculated using the formula N(N−1)/2, where N is the number of nodes.

Steps to Configure in Packet Tracer
Add Devices:

From the "End Devices" menu, add several PCs (e.g., PC0, PC1, PC2, PC3). This example uses four PCs for a small-scale mesh.

Connect Devices:

Select the Connections tool and choose the Copper Cross-Over cable.

Click on PC0 and connect it to PC1, PC2, and PC3.

Connect PC1 to PC2 and PC3.

Connect PC2 to PC3.

Ensure every device is connected to every other device. For four PCs, you will need 4(4−1)/2=6 connections.

Configure IP Addresses:

For each pair of connected PCs, you will need to assign IP addresses that are on the same subnet. This is a crucial difference from the star topology, as there is no central device to manage the network.

Click on a PC, go to Desktop > IP Configuration, and configure the IP address and subnet mask for each connection. This requires careful planning. For example, for the link between PC0 and PC1, you could use 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2 respectively.

The ping command is essential here for testing individual links between devices.
